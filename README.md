## Linear regression to predict mpg

  r square value
  
### Summary Statistics on Suspension Coil
  total summary: the data shows a variance of 62.29356 pounds per square inch
                 the variance is within the tolerance of 100 pounds per square inch
                 the summary data reflects all lots (1, 2, 3)
                 
  lot summary:  the lot summary breaks down the performance by lot
                lot 1 data shows a variance of .9795918 this punds per square inch
                  this is well within the 100 pounds per square inch tolerance
                lot 2 data shows a variance of 7.4693878 poounds per square inch
                  this is well within the 100 pounds per square inch tolerance
                lot 3 data shows a variance of 170.2861224 pounds per square inch
                  this is well over the 100 pounds per square inch
                  
  comment: the overall summary variance is within the tolerance due to the performance
                  of lots 1 and 2
           the lot summary shows that lot 1 and 2 are within tolerance but lot 3
                is way out of tolerance and is contributing negatively to the 
                maufacturing process

 #### Study comparing Mechacar to the competition
  metrics to test: actual mpg for comperaple modles
    vehicle weights
    engine type
    body shape
    tire sizes and types
    preventive maintenance intervals
    repair costs
    vehicle purchase price
    annual operating costs
    
  use linear regression models to analyze the affect each matric has on mpg and total operating costs
  use two sample t-test to compare Mechacar data to competition data
  use ANOVA to compare the data from all different tests
  
  Null hypothesis is that there is no difference in Mechacar mpg and its competitors that is caused by vehicle design

  Alternative hypothesis is that mpg is different due to vehicle design

  The linear regression will show any effects that each feature (vehicle weight, engine type, etc.). 
  The two-sample t-test will compare Mechacar data to its competitors.
  The ANOVA will compare data from all tests.
